# USCensus

This repository contains a project to use US Census Data to predict whether earnings are above or below $50k.

It explores and visualises the data, evaluates strongest features, performs feature engineering and tests classifier models for the binary prediction. There are many suggestions for how the project could be continued and improved.

The main analysis can be found in the notebook: US_Census_Earnings_Predictions.ipynb with additional training in Parameter Tuning for Tree Algorithms.ipynb.
